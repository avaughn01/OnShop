node_modules needs to be extracted and in same directory as index.js and index.html
our website will use the index.js and index.html files the other .js and .html files are there as examples of how to do stuff

-->
We still need a login.html, registration.html, feedback.html, UserProfile.html, ChatWithRep.html pages created and designed.

I e-mailed everyone a launch.json for vscode.  I do not believe you need this.  It should just be your profile properties on what vscode does on startup.  If you want you can edit it yourself.  It is programmed in bash....amazing.
